Reflection

In today's session we were introduced to GIT/Github. We were shown a quick demo on the advantages of using VSCode. We installed an extension on to VSCode. We have done an introductory demonstration of how to commit changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machine. 

10 years ago I used to use Notepad++ and this is much better.
